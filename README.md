# How to use
The file Main_code.R calls all the different steps of the analysis for all considered parameters
The analysis is divided in 5 main steps:
  1. Data preparation
  2. Analysis at the plot level
  3. Landscape simulations
  4. Analysis of the simulated data to calculate landscape-level multifunctionality
  5. Creating plots and interpretable data.
Scripts 1-3 necessitate the access to raw data, which has currently not been made public. They are provided for information purposes only. However, pre-calculated landscape-level datasets for multiple parameters are publicly available on the Biodiversity Exploratories information system (doi and link tba).

# Shiny app
The pre-calculated data can also be used as an input to reproduce the Shiny App provided in the ShinyApp folder.
